is a group exhibition of NFTs held as part of the Web3 Tales conference at the beginning of June at the Museum of Contemporary Art, organized by the Alice in Blockchains association and partner Base58</em></p><p>‍</p><p>On June 1 and 2, 2023, the unique Web3 Tales conference will be held at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Zagreb, Croatia, organized by the Alice in Blockchains association. There the future of the Internet will be discussed, as well as the potential and practical applications of blockchain technology, decentralized finance, NFTs, Web3 gaming and metaverse to our private and business everyday life.</p><p>As part of the conference, the NFT exhibition &quot;Techno-Healing: Finding Resilience and Well-Being in a Digital World&quot; will be held, which will remain open to the general public for several days after the end of the conference.</p><p>The goal of the conference is decentralization, greater inclusiveness and diversification in the world of new technologies, and in that spirit this group exhibition brings together a diverse group of digital artists who explore the topics of feminism, non-binary, health and self-care in the digital age.</p><p>&quot;Techno-Healing: Finding Resilience and Well-Being in a Digital World&quot; is curated by Petra Tomljanović, art historian, curator and author. She is interested in how digital technologies of the 21st century affect the production, perception and distribution of contemporary art. So far, she has curated over 50 exhibitions and published articles on the combination of information technology and art. She has a master&#x27;s degree in art history and literature and MAS curatorial studies from Zhdk. She lives and works in Zurich, where she runs the art gallery Kulturfolger.</p><p><em>&quot;The exhibition &quot;Techno Healing - Finding Resilience and Wellbeing in the Digital World&quot; gathers a group of female artists and non-binary persons whose work deals with the dominant male discourse of technology and blockchain. This exhibition highlights the themes of wellness and feminism, which are especially relevant in a world where capitalism exploits the promise of women&#x27;s health and beauty through apps, trackers and meditation guides, where we are expected to become the best versions of ourselves. However, the question arises as to how much this is another way of exploitation, which gives us the appearance of control over our bodies, while we are actually exploiting ourselves in another way.</em></p><p><em>Within the digital world there are spaces where we can feel freer and more honest than in the &quot;physical&quot; world, which is made possible by web3. In this context, Rosa Braidotti&#x27;s theoretical perspective provides useful insights into the importance of the body in the context of identity and technology, particularly in relation to the female body. The concept of the &quot;posthuman body&quot;, found in Braidotti&#x27;s work &quot;The Posthuman&quot; (2013), opens new perspectives for understanding the body in the digital age, especially in the context of feminist theories.</em></p><p><em>What makes this exhibition special is the fact that all the exhibitors are pioneers of digital creation, and some are even among the first to adopt blockchain as a storage method in their practice. Through their work, these artists have opened the discourse of &quot;ownership&quot; of digital work, creating new models where artists can own their digital works and control their distribution. Their innovative and brave practice opens the door to new ways of thinking about the role of technology in art and culture in general&quot;,</em> said curator Petra Tomljanović.</p><p>Gretchen Andrew, Carla Gannis, Lauren Moffatt, Mieke Marple, Rory Scott, Sasha Stiles, Anna Fries, CROSSLUCID, and Claudia Hart will show their works. Through a variety of media, including digital art, poetry and interactive installations, these artists will offer new perspectives on the ways in which technology and social media can empower but also harm women, and will invite viewers to consider the role of feminism in fostering resilience and well-being in coping with these challenges. </p><p>By showcasing their work through NFTs, we are creating a platform for these artists to reach a global audience and show innovative ways that are thought provoking and explore pressing social issues.</p><p><em>&quot;I believe art and NFTs can play an incredibly important role in helping people navigate and find meaning in the digital age. As our lives become increasingly intertwined with technology, it can be easy to feel disconnected or overwhelmed by the overwhelming amount of information and stimuli we encounter every day. By creating art that explores themes of resilience, well-being and self-care, we can help counter these negative effects and give people the tools to cope and thrive in the digital age. Furthermore, by using NFTs to authenticate and distribute this art, we can help establish its value and importance in the art world, ensuring it reaches a wider audience and contributes to a wider conversation about the intersection of technology, art and the human experience,&quot;</em> said artist Rory Scott .</p><p>The NFT exhibition &quot;Techno-Healing: Finding Resilience and Well-Being in a Digital World&quot; will be set up as part of the Web3 Tales conference organized by the Alice in Blockchains association, but the exhibition will be open to the general public after the end of the conference.</p><p><em>&quot;We want the Web3 Tales conference to be a meeting place, an exchange of ideas, and an opportunity to create new partnerships and business opportunities for individuals and companies that will work together to build a better, more open and transparent digital future,&quot;</em> concluded Magda Milas from Alice in Blockchains.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>About the Alice in Blockchains association</strong></p><p>The Alice in Blockchains association aims to inspire women to explore their potential and actively get involved in the fintech and blockchain industries.

Since the late ‘90s when she began working with 3D animation, Hart embraced these same concepts, but now focusing on the impact of computing and simulation technologies. She was an early adopter of virtual imaging, using 3D animation to make media installations and projections, and later as they were invented, other forms of VR, AR, and objects produced by computer-driven production machines. At the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where she is a professor, she developed a pedagogic program based on her practice – Experimental 3D – the first dedicated solely to teaching simulations technologies in an art-school context. Hart’s works are widely exhibited and collected by galleries and museums including the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Metropolitan Museum. Her work has been shown at the New Museum, produced at the Eyebeam Center for Art + Technology, where she was an honorary fellow in 2013-14, at Pioneer Works, NY, where she a technology resident in 2018, and at the Center for New Music and Audio Technology, UC California, Berkeley where she is currently a Fellow.</p><p>‍</p><p>Mieke Marple:</p><p>‍<br/>Mieke Marple is an artist, writer, and activist living in San Francisco.

Year.<br/>Using digital and handcrafted means, Scott explores the ideas of impermanence, reality, the passage of time, and the impact of technology on human evolution. In her work, she primarily uses patterns to create visual parallels between the existence of patterns in nature and the rhythm of our thoughts and our lives. She illustrates that repetition over time creates form and ultimately the reality we exprrience. Using tools such as animation, projection, augmented/virtual reality, VQGAN+CLIPS, and handcrafted miniature sets, Scott attempts to create worlds that transport the viewer into environments that are tangible and dream-like and evoke a déjà vu experience. “What defines being human more than impermanence? It’s what we all have in common, but are reluctant to share. I hope that upon viewing my work, people will feel a sense of connection with me and our shared experience of time travel.” Rory Scott currently resides<br/>in Chincago and.
